      <p>For confidentiality reasons, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) can only discuss a file with the person who receives the&nbsp;benefits or credits.

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



      <h2 id="chng_ddrss">You change your address</h2>
<p>You need to tell&nbsp;us your new address if you move. Your benefit and credit payments may stop if you do not.

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



      <h3>Your child is born or a child starts to live with you</h3>
<p>You need to apply for child benefits&nbsp;when your child is born or a child starts to live with you.</p>  <p>You also need to register that child for the GST/HST credit. You can use <a href="../e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a> or complete <a></a><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc66.html">Form RC66, Canada Child Benefits Application</a>.</p>

      <h3>A child is no longer in your care</h3>
<p>You need to tell us right away if you are getting benefit or credit payments for a child that is no longer in your care, stops living with you, or dies.&nbsp;This will avoid overpayments and requests to pay back some of your benefits.</p>  <p>Your entitlement to benefit&nbsp;payments stops the month after the child is no longer in your care.</p>  <p>If you are receiving the GST/HST credit for a child who&nbsp;moves,&nbsp;becomes a spouse or common-law partner <strong>or</strong> a parent, you must also let us know.</p>  <p>You can let us know in one of the following ways:</p>  <ul>
<li>use "End care of child" on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-mobile-apps.html">MyBenefits CRA</a> mobile application or <a href="../e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a></li>
<li>by contacting us</li>
</ul>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



      <h3>You start or end sharing custody of a child</h3>
<p>You must apply for shared benefits or credits when you start sharing custody of a child.</p>
<p>If you <strong>already</strong> get the benefit or credit for a child, apply for shared&nbsp;benefits and credits&nbsp;by using &quot;Apply for child benefits&quot; in <a href="../e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a> or&nbsp;calling 1-800-387-1193.</p>
<p>When a shared custody situation <strong>ends</strong>, you&nbsp;have to let us know in one of the following ways.</p>
<p>If the child is <strong>no longer in your care</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>use &quot;End care of child&quot; on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-mobile-apps.html">MyBenefits CRA</a> mobile application or <a href="../e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a></li>
<li>contact us</li>
</ul>
<p>If the child is now <strong>living with you full-time</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the online service “Apply for child benefits” on <a href="../e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a></li>
<li>send us a completed <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc66.html">Form RC66, Canada Child Benefits Application</a></li>

</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



      <h2 id="dth">A death has occurred</h2>
<p>Let us know if any of the following situations apply:</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



      <h3>Child benefits:</h3>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



      <h4>The benefit recipient has died</h4>
<p>If the benefit recipient has died, the next of kin or the estate&nbsp;has to&nbsp;tell us as soon as possible. Someone else may be eligible to get the benefits for the child.</p>  <p>If you are the surviving spouse or common-law partner of the former recipient, in most cases you won't have to fill out a new child benefits application. The child will be transferred automatically to your account.</p>  <p>We may still send a payment after the date of death if we are not aware of the death. If this happens, return the payment to your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/address-tax-centre-mail-your-forms.html">tax centre</a> with a brief letter of explanation.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



      <h4>You are the benefit recipient and your spouse or common-law partner has died</h4>
<p>If you receive benefit payments for a child and your spouse or common-law partner dies, contact us to tell us&nbsp;his or her&nbsp;date of death.&nbsp; We will recalculate your payments to adjust your family net income.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



      <h4>You are the new primary caregiver</h4>
<p>If anyone other than the parent is now primarily responsible for the child (such as a grandparent or guardian), that person will have to apply for benefit payments for the child in one of these ways:</p>  <ul>
<li>use the "Apply for child benefits" online service on <a href="../e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a></li>
<li>complete and send us <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc66.html">Form RC66, Canada Child Benefits Application</a></li>
</ul>  <p>If the deceased recipient was getting payments under provincial or territorial child benefit and credit programs administered by the CRA, there is no need to apply separately. We will use the information from your completed application to determine the new caregiver's eligibility for these programs.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



      <h3>GST/HST credit:</h3>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



      <h4>The GST/HST credit recipient has died</h4>
<p>An individual is not entitled to receive GST/HST credit payments after he or she dies. The CRA may send a payment after the date of death if we are unaware of the situation. If this happens, please return the payment to your <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/address-tax-centre-mail-your-forms.html">tax centre</a> and let us know the date of death so we can update our records.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



      <h4>The deceased was single, separated, divorced, or widowed</h4>
<p>If the individual died before the month that the CRA issues the credit, we cannot make any more payments in that person's name or to that person's estate.</p>  <p>If the individual died during or after the month that the CRA issues the credit, and the payment has not been cashed, please return it to the CRA so that we can send the payment to the person's estate.</p>  <p>If the individual had been receiving a credit for a child, the child's new caregiver should contact the CRA to request GST/HST credit payments for that child.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



      <h4>The deceased was married or living common law</h4>
<p>If his or her GST/HST credit included an amount for a spouse or common-law partner, that spouse or common-law partner can ask to receive any remaining GST/HST credit payments for himself or herself and for any of their children. If the spouse or common-law partner did not file a return for the previous year, he or she must do so.</p>



</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">



      <h2 id="stts_chng">You or your spouse or common-law partner's residency status has changed</h2>
<p>If you or your spouse or common-law partner’s residency status has changed, contact us.</p>  <p>If your non-resident spouse or common-law partner <strong>immigrates</strong> to Canada, he or she must provide <strong>all</strong> of the following information in writing immediately:</p>  <ul>
<li>social insurance number</li>

<li>address</li>
<li>immigration date</li>
