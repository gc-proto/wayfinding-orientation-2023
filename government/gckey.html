			<hr size="6" width="100%" color="blue">
			<p>A GCKey username and password can be used to sign in to <strong>any Government of Canada online
					account</strong> that supports GCKey.</p>
			<p><strong>It's not an account.</strong> Once you create a GCKey username and password, you still have to
				register for each online account to match them to your account profile.

			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="./sign-in-online-account.html">List of all accounts</a></li>
			</ul>

			<p>You usually only need one GCKey username and password to sign in to any government service that
				supports
				GCKey.</p>
			<p>For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>create a GCKey username and password to register and reserve a campsite in My Parks Canada
					Reservation Account</li>
				<li>then use your same GCKey username and password to register and sign in to My Service Canada
					Account
					to manage your Employment Insurance or Canada Pension</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>Expiry:</strong> GCKey usernames and passwords expire if they're not used for two years or
				more.
				If your GCKey expires you'll need to sign up for a new one.</p>
			<h2><a id="errors"></a>Browser errors and technical problems</h2>
			<hr size="6" width="100%" color="blue">
			<p>You can use the same GCKey username and password on different computers, phones and tablets.</p>
			<p>If you're getting error messages:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>use a modern web browser like Safari, Chrome, Firefox or Microsoft Edge, rather than Internet
					Explorer</li>
				<li>use your browser's default settings because GCKey needs JavaScript and
					cookies enabled</li>
				<li>don't bookmark pages that you see after you sign in - you must sign in to see them</li>

				<p>On the&nbsp;<strong>Optional Account Recovery</strong>&nbsp;page you should add an email

					username or
					password. This step is optional but highly recommended.</p>
				<p>As you enter an email address a red “x” or a green checkmark will appear in

				<h5>If your email address has already been used</h5>
				<p>If your email address is associated with another GCKey username, a warning message will appear

				<p>You have 3 options:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Attempt to recover the username and/or password of the other GCKey username associated

				<p>You can have more than one GCKey username and password. For example, you may want one for

				<p>If you do create more than one GCKey:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>remember which username and password you use for each type of service</li>
					<li>use a different recovery email address for each GCKey username</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have more than one GCKey, ensure you keep track of which GCKey
					you have
					associated with each government account. Once a GCKey is linked to a specific government

					you need to use the same GCKey username and password to sign in each time.</p>
			</details>

				<summary><a id="authentication"></a>Two-factor authentication</summary>
				<p>Once you have created your GCKey username and password you may be asked to choose a method of

					GCKey. This helps prevent unauthorized access to your online accounts and services. </p>

			<p>If your GCKey has been revoked you <strong>cannot</strong> recover it.</p>
			<p> If your GCKey has been revoked, it is most likely due to one of the following reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your GCKey has expired - the system requires you to use your GCKey at least once every
					two years, otherwise your account will be revoked</li>
				<li>Your GCKey username and password have been compromised - it's essential that
					<strong>none of
						your online accounts</strong> of any kind share the same username and password
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you have any questions about why your GCKey has been revoked, please contact the
				government department for which you are trying to access services.</p>
			<h3>Sign up for a new GCKey username and password and reconnect it to your accounts</h3>
			<p>If your GCKey has been revoked but you still want to use GCKey to access your Government of
				Canada online accounts, you can register for a new GCKey username and password.</p>
			<!--  <p>First select the <strong>Sign Up</strong> button on the GCKey welcome page and follow the
